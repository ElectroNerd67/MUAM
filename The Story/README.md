## The Story of My Uncle and Me

# Chapter 1
"Did you say Evverrything?"
     
It was a cool autumn afternoon as I walked down the street in this busy city. I had a day off from work unexpectedly, I didn't want to stay home so I went for a walk to set my mind straight. Graduated from the university and still live with my parents. My life is pathetic.

I was not happy and was not sad about my life, but I was hoping I can find something in my life that will fulfill my purpose and meaning in life.

I walked and walked til I saw a long line stretching out on to a side walk, it appears a new restaurant has opened up.

I was told of legends and heard stories of a foreign restaurant chain that only shows itself to the most promising of areas in the world.

With no purpose in life today, I figured, hey... I will check this out. I waited in line for hours.

I opened the steel glass door and this smell overcame me, a sweet and meaty aroma that only one can hope may be the answer or direction of my life that I have been looking for. As I approached the counter.. I saw a very chiseled well groomed man, a clean and neat haircut of white magical hair, and well maintain goatee, and most of all.... glasses...

He looked like a deer caught in headlights when I stared blankly at him, he asked me something and I did not hear them as I was awe struck with his amazing beauty and lean figure. Finally, after a few seconds that felt like hours, he managed to stammer out, "I I I apologize, I didn't mean to distract you... I haven't even had a full day yet alone known you a full day yet."

"What's on the menu Sir? I have never been to such a establishment before, I Guess crazy runs in the family for not going out often." That got a good laugh from both of us. Once the laughter died, we both sat there in silence, expecting the other to say or do something first.

Eventually, The man of my momentary fantasy spoke. "My Name is Colonel Sander-son, and everything is on the menu..."
"E-e-everything?" I stuttered as I stared at his gorgeous chiseled face and chest, that amazing apron just compliments the wild imagination I have of his figure, leaving only my imagination of what's below and behind the counter.
He winked slightly at my question and took a few moments to consider his response. Sander-son replies under his breath, "Evverrything..."

"I will take the open house special for one for here please" I spoke calmly as customers were beginning to stare at me taking my time at the front counter.
"We have a special bonus after your meal since you are the 100th customer of the day, if you are interested, we can talk about it more in my office after your meal sir"
"Thank you Sander-son... I will..."

# Chapter 2
"My life finding purpose"

I finished my meal and sat there at the table with a empty tray, I do not even know what it tasted like, I was like a machine that went thru the movement of eating but my mind was stuck on Sander-son..
What was this feeling I am having...
I looked over and stared at Sander-son's eyes.... He gave me a stern look and nodded. I got up from my table and proceeded to walk to wards him and he stares at the direction of his office.
The wooden door closed behind me as we both entered. The click of the lock was heard but I was more focus on the open chair in front of me when I entered. He had a corner desk with a lamp and laptop, no windows were visible.
He lifted our hands to my mouth and kissed the back of his. "Thank you for coming in. It's the first time anyone spoke to me with their eyes at a grand opening. Honestly, I always felt abandoned on opening days with the new restaurant. People tend to be more interested in just getting their food and leaving.
"So, I need to ask, this isn't weird for you?" He spoke softly.
"Why? Is it weird for you?" I then replied
"Honestly, no. I mean I just met you for the first time. Maybe if I had seen you growing up and knew you your whole life, it would be a little weird. But, the fact we're not related doesn't matter to me. I can understand why it could be bad if either of us were female, but since neither of us can get pregnant, there's no risk of a child being born with defects."
"That's how I think about it too. I don't see anything wrong with two consenting adults doing what they want. We're not hurting anyone. Still, I don't think we should tell my parents about us. I don't think they would like that too much."

"I agree. And if you meet any of my friends, we'll leave out the detailed parts."

"The only one we might have to tell is the employees. They going to figure out that I'm seeing someone and when they meet you, they may know the truth, and my reputation will be shunned upon."

"Well, does anyone know your personal family Sander-son?"

Sander-son shook his head no side to side.

"So, can I call you uncle then?"

"I honestly don't know if they'll have a problem with it or not."

"Why should it matter?"

He started to blush and looked away from me. We begun to run our hands under each other's shirt feeling and rubbing every inch of pure body tone, his nipples were hard a steel bolt. We began to softly kiss and the lights turn off.

I thought to myself while experienced a new type of euphoria I never felt before.

My whole life was a lie, everything I grew up believing was wrong. My purpose and direction has been found.

I’m going to go down on you, and I won’t even let you think about returning the favor I continued to say in my head.

My mouth was cleaned from the pure creaminess of the mashed potatoes, the savory warmth of the gravy from the meal earlier.

Sander-son whispered softly, "I’d put on music, but I don’t want to drown out the sounds of your sexy little moans."

I whispered calmly. "Don’t stop me once you come, because I’m planning on giving you multiple orgasms today."



# Prologue Title to Chapter 3

"I wanted a Burger King Dating Simulator Instead"
"Well you ain't gettin it"

"How do I add to this adventure?", I asked myself.

"This feels like a broken drillpress!", I told myself.

I pulled my thoughts together. The Burger King Dating Simulator must be obtainable somehow?
